# ImageCompV2

*NOTE:* It is the exact same code than the previous version, the only thing that changed was the way I uploaded the repo. This one is more organized and can be cloned to run 
as a Visual Studio Project. The other one probably not. If you want to make the comparison between codes, here is the link to the other [repo](https://github.com/CelisIvan/CUDAImageCompare).
